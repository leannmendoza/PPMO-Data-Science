Exploratory data science and machine learning analysis of statistical project management data to optimize project planning and management

## predicting_project_survival_using_skl.ipynb
Modeled after the common machine learning project "predicting passenger survival based on titanic data," this project looks at raw project management data taken from Atlassian's Jira platform, and predicts projection of "survival." We define survival as "will this project meet its anticipated end date +/- 5 days?" with the intention of the model picking up on key features such as milestone counts, staff counts, what does the project volatility like  right now. Predicting with 99.17% accuracy (although over a pessimistic, unbalanced dataset), this analysis proves that we should open up a seat at the table for ML in statistical project management.
